    Files and directory structure:
    * File names and placement in the file tree should be canonical to the programming language at hand.
    * When adding new functionality, follow the principles of modularity, testability, and separation of concerns. Create new modules, directories, as needed. Avoid cluttering the top level directory.
    
    Tests:
    * Should be placed in a location canonical to the programming language. 
    * When possible, add a test that corresponds directly to the change. If not, add a script that can be run to verify the change instead.
    * Don't use mock. When it is too difficult to test without mock, add a script that can be run to verify the change instead.

    Dependency management:
    * When adding a new dependency, check if the dependency is already declared or used in the package scope. If not, add the dependency to the package management system. If a dependency is added, call that out in the response, and provide the commands needed to install the dependency.
